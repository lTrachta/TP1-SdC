 %     	the percentage of the total running time of the
time   	program used by this function.

cumulative a running sum of the number of seconds accounted
 seconds   for by this function and those listed above it.

 self  	the number of seconds accounted for by this
seconds	function alone.  This is the major sort for this
       	listing.

calls  	the number of times this function was invoked, if
       	this function is profiled, else blank.

 self  	the average number of milliseconds spent in this
ms/call	function per call, if this function is profiled,
   	else blank.

 total 	the average number of milliseconds spent in this
ms/call	function and its descendents per call, if this
   	function is profiled, else blank.

name   	the name of the function.  This is the minor sort
       	for this listing. The index shows the location of
   	the function in the gprof listing. If the index is
   	in parenthesis it shows where it would appear in
   	the gprof listing if it were to be printed.
